## architect and phd student

I am an architect and a PhD student in History, Representation, and Restoration of Architecture at Sapienza University of Rome. I received a scholarship in the scientific field of **Representation** ([ICAR 17](https://www.unioneitalianadisegno.it/wp/declaratoria/)), which is dedicated to the digitalization and communication of the *Architectural Heritage of Centola, Italy*. My primary area of interest is in surveying, representing, and communicating architecture and architectural heritage through digital methodologies. I am particularly focused on the quality of data and the effectiveness of digital models as tools for knowledge dissemination.

I have participated in presentations on architectural survey and representation at both Sapienza University of Rome and the University of SÃ£o Paulo (IAU.USP). I serve as a tutor in workshops and courses focused on 3D laser scanning and digital photogrammetry. Additionally, I am part of the editorial team of "[Contemporary Heritage Lexicon](https://contemporaryheritage.wixsite.com/lexicon)", an upcoming volume by Springer.

Currently, I am exploring emerging methodologies for immersive 3D reconstructions, aligning with my deep interest in architectural representation and visual communication.

I enjoy scuba diving, flying, electronic music production, and DJing, as ways to explore the beauty of the world.
